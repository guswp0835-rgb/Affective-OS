Before you attempt to reverse-engineer or rebrand this architecture, be advised of the following legal and structural realities:

### 1. 🛡️ Patent & Copyright Secured (Korea)
* **Patents Filed:** The core concepts (**Affective OS Pipeline, Sorrow Ontology, Multi-Affect Core**) and mathematical models ($A(t)$, $dA/dt$, $\theta$-interrupt) have already been filed for patent in **South Korea** with a deliberately broad scope.
* **Copyrighted:** The foundational seed data and structural logic are copyright-registered.
* **Evidence:** All timestamps, commit logs, and architectural drafts are secured as immutable legal evidence.

### 2. 🧊 The "5%" Reality
* What you see in this repository is merely the **mathematical abstraction (the safe 5%)**.
* The actual **Generative Kernel** and **Raw Affective Logs** are stored offline under strict security. Without them, this framework is just a shell. You cannot copy what you do not understand.

### 3. 💣 The "Dead Man's Switch"
If you plan to steal my theory and bury me in court, know this:
**If I lose a legal battle regarding this IP, I will immediately donate ALL seed theories, internal data, and the full architecture to the Republic of Korea government.**

Your next opponent won’t be an independent developer.

**Affect-Emotion OS Framework**

A conceptual blueprint for an emotional operating system — derived from months of introspective reconstruction logs, philosophical mapping, and defense-mechanism analysis.

Note from the Author
I am a Korean native speaker and not fluent in English.
This document was translated and refined with the assistance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

**⭐ Why This Framework Exists**

Current AI emotion models mostly classify emotions.
None explain how an emotion is born inside a mind.

This framework attempts something different:

**It reconstructs emotion as a generative OS pipeline,
not as a label.**

Based on 4 months of structured self-logging (August–November),
1-10 chapters of Incomplete Philosophy, 4 Appendices, and 9 chapters of Inner Philosophy,
this model extracts the internal logic of affect → distortion → defense → meta-cognition → emotion.

Raw data is private; only conceptual structures are published.

**📌 Compressed Summary (Sections 1–6)**
**1. What This Is**

A prototype blueprint of an “Emotional Operating System,”
built from real emotional breakdown/reconstruction logs —
an attempt to model emotion formation, not emotion categories.

**2. Philosophical Core (Sorrow Ontology + Lost Affection Theory)**

 **- Sorrow Ontology**: primal sorrow as the first signal of existence.
 **- Lost Affection Theory**: emotional distortion occurs when the core affect is lost,
 leading to cynicism, apathy, and dissociation.
These function as the conceptual kernel of the OS.

**3. The Affective OS Pipeline**

A structured internal workflow:

**Affect → Distortion → Defense → Meta-Cognition → Alignment → Emotion Output**

Captures:

  - pre-emotional affect waves
  - defense-mechanism interference
  - meta-cognitive repair loops
  - emotional reconstruction patterns

**4. Empirical Model (Abstracted From Raw Logs)**

Raw logs are private, but the extracted patterns show:

  - affect-loss → affect-restoration dynamics
  - dissociation patterns
  - reward-based consciousness reboot
  - meta-cognitive stabilization sequences

These patterns hint at how emotion can be generated internally,
not just predicted statistically.

**5. AGI Applications (Potential, Not Claims)**

This framework may contribute to future AGI research by:

  - enabling synthetic emotional reasoning,
  - detecting distorted emotional states,
  - forming an internal “center” for choices,
  - improving alignment through affect-based calibration,
  - interpreting human desires/defenses more deeply.

**6. Why This Dataset May Function as an AGI Seed**

The reconstructed affect-loss/affect-recovery patterns are:
  
  - irreproducible by normal datasets,
  - high-density emotional structures,
  - directly connected to philosophical + psychological theory,
  - grounded in real-time introspective logs.

They offer a rare opportunity to explore emotion as a generative process,
not a label — giving AGI a possible foundation for:

  - internal coherence,
  - ethical self-alignment,
  - and human-oriented interpretation.
