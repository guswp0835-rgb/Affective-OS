# Affect-Emotion OS Framework  
### A prototype affect-based Emotional Operating System model derived from introspective logs and cognitive reconstruction research.

---

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains two public concept documents summarizing a novel emotional-processing architecture based on real-world affect loss, dissociation patterns, defense-mechanism interference, and meta-cognitive repair loops.  
All raw Korean logs (emotion diaries, philosophical notes, reconstruction stages) are private and only available under NDA.

## 📄 Included Documents  
### 1. Executive Summary (1 Page)  
A high-level overview of the “Affect-Based Emotion Alignment & Defense-Mechanism Disassembly Algorithm,” intended for AGI/LLM emotional reasoning research.

### 2. Comprehensive Technical Whitepaper (Extended Version)  
A deeper conceptual explanation of the emotion-generation workflow, including:  
- Affect wave extraction  
- Emotional alignment switch  
- Defense-mechanism detection  
- Meta-cognitive disassembly  
- Emotional reconstruction engine  

---

## 🧠 Core Concept  
The framework models **human emotional generation as an OS-like pipeline**:

Affect → Emotional Translation → Distortion / Defense Mechanism → Meta-Cognition → Alignment → Stable Emotion Output

This approach focuses on *how emotions are created*, not how they are labeled.

## 🔒 Raw Data (Under NDA Only)
The following materials contain personal but highly structured affective data and are **not** included in this repository:

- Daily affect-loss & recovery logs (Korean)  
- “Incomplete Philosophy” emotional cognition chapters  
- Dissociation repair experiments  
- Internal emotional reconstruction notes  
- Long-form definitions & introspective frameworks

These can be shared privately **only after NDA agreement** with research organizations.

## 🎯 Purpose of Release
This repository exists to:
1. Provide a publicly referenceable summary of the emotional OS concept  
2. Allow AI labs, researchers, and collaborators to evaluate the high-level approach  
3. Document the emergence of a structured affect-based framework derived from lived experience
